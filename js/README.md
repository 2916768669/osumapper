Work in progress: a web interface for osumapper using tensorflow.js.

Progress:

- Get TFJS working                          100%
- Read MP3 data with webaudio               100%
- Try out the BPM Analyzer                  0%
- Figure out how to import the keras model  88.3%
- Build up a GAN using the JS version       65%
- Port other code besides GAN to JS         75%
- Connect the data flow                     25%
- Draw a cute UI                            0%
- Testing                                   15%
- Actually implement a cute UI              hmm%

why cannot use RNN!!!
error: computeMask is not implemented for RNN yet
\_(:ли)Рѕа)\_

and cannot support grads for less and greater
(although it should not be differentiable at all, how did the original tf deal with this)

I should play more games
